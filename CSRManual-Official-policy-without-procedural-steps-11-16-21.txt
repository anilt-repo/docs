CASH PROCESSING PROCEDURE



	In the morning, you are assigned a cash bag with $75.00.  You must open a cash drawer in RIMS before processing any transactions for the day.  You will count the money in the bag to ensure the correct amount is contained.  Once this is complete, you will (In RIMS) select the bag number indicated on the blue bag and also select the counter which you will be working from for the day.

	If there is a discrepancy in the amount of money contained in the blue bag, notify your immediate Supervisor.

	If there are no more cash bags remaining, you must select an asterisk * number when opening your cash drawer.  This simply means that you did not take a $75.00 bag to begin the day and will not be responsible for that money at days end.
	
	You are responsible for all overages and shortages in your cash drawer.  Excessive discrepancies may result in disciplinary action.

	During the course of the day, keep the cash drawer neat and denominations of bills separate.  Keep checks separate from your money, and in order, by transaction.  Make sure customer’s license number and/or registration number is recorded at the top of the check and/or credit card receipts.  Any monetary denomination of $10 or greater must be marked with a counterfeit pen.

	Always double-check the amount on your payment screen and the amount written on the check.  THIS IS A VERY COMMON MISTAKE.  Make certain the legal line and check amount match and that the amount is correct.  Also make sure that all checks are signed by the customer.  Any shortage/overage is your responsibility.

	NO third-party checks or temporary checks are accepted (no exceptions).  Example of third-party check: A check from your friend, neighbor, etc.  Check must have same last name and/or same address as the person who is transacting.

	Temporary checks CANNOT be accepted as payment.


	At the end each business day, you must account for cash, checks, credit cards, money orders and vouchers when you “Submit Drawer”.  If you were assigned a cash bag at the beginning of the day, you must place the $75.00 that was provided to you, back in the blue bag. 

	Once you have counted your startup bag, proceed to count your cash.

	Keep all cash facing the same way (same direction).

	Count your cash individually by denomination and enter into RIMS (Submit Drawer).  For example, 5 pennies, 10 dimes, 8 quarters, 10 one dollar bills etc.

	Match up and verify the checks in your drawer, to what is listed in RIMS when Submitting Drawer.  Make sure you have all checks that are listed in RIMS and the amounts are correct.  See “Submit Drawer” in your RIMS procedural steps for more detailed instruction.


	Match up and verify your credit card receipts with RIMS “Details”.  Verify you have all receipts listed and that amounts match.  See “Submit Drawer” in your RIMS procedural steps for more detailed instruction. 

	Follow the same steps to verify money orders and vouchers.  See “Submit Drawer” in your RIMS procedural steps for more detailed instruction. 

	When all forms of payment have been accounted for and verified you will Submit Drawer  then print your Draw Summary.

	A second clerk or supervisor must then recount your cash, checks credit cards etc., and sign the Daily Reconciliation Sheet.  The sheet must be filled out completely, signed by you and by the employee who performed the second count. 

	All cash, checks, cc’s and other forms of payment must be placed into a black bag with the Reconciliation Sheet.  Loose change must be put into a small envelope and secured with tape or a staple.  The black bag containing all monies and Reconciliation Sheet, will be placed in the secure drop box or safe, depending on the location.  In Cranston, you will include all sales tax forms in your black bag.  They should paperclipped together and have your first initial, last name, clerk number and date.  In the branches sales tax forms will be put into a separate envelope at days end instead of with your money. 

	No third-party credit cards are accepted for payments for a transaction.  The only exception is for immediate family (i.e., parent, legal guardian, brother, sister, including step and half).  The person whose name is on the credit card being used MUST BE PRESENT during the time of transaction.

QUEUE PROCEDURE


Purpose:  To articulate the philosophy on how the Q-matic process will be directed on the second floor within the “Football”.

Each customer will report to the Check-in Booth where a Customer Service Representative (CSR) will review the intended transaction, ensure there is no tax block or suspension that will prevent the transaction from being completed.  If there is a reason why a transaction cannot be completed, the customer will be sent to the appropriate unit (Adjudication, Taxation, Research and Title, etc.) to address the block.  These customers will not be given a ticket until the block on their transaction has been addressed.  Once they have addressed their block, customers will report to the Check-in Booth to receive a ticket.  

If there are no blocks to completing their transaction, the CSR will provide and explain, if necessary, what forms are required for the transaction.  Customers will be given a corresponding series ticket and wait for their ticket to be called before entering the football area.

Each transaction type has a predetermined actual maximum wait time.  They are as follows:

A = Registration 	 				1000 series
B = License 					            2000 series
C = Blue Return					3000 series
D = Supervisor/Information				4000 series
E = Reservations 			                        5000 series
F = Exams 					            6000 series
G = Special Issues (Elderly, Military, etc.)		9000 series

No customer will enter the “football” area without a ticket.

Military personnel, elderly and/or disabled persons will also be able to access the express line at the Check-in Booth.  

One Supervisor will be assigned the daily responsibility of “managing” the Q-matic program.  If the assigned Supervisor goes on break, the responsibility will be passed off to another Supervisor so there will be continuity in the implementation of the Q-matic program.

Based on the assigned wait times, each transaction will be consistently balanced so that all transactions have the same percentage wait time. 
For example:  If registrations are running at a maximum of two hours, licenses should run at a maximum of one hour thirty minutes and registration and license express should run at a maximum of one hour.     

When wait times exceed one hour thirty minutes, customers will begin to be queued up.  If wait times exceed one hour forty-five minutes, an “All Hands-on Deck” notice will be sent by e-mail by the Administrator, his/her designee and/or an Assistant Administrator(s).  At that time, any Supervisor or Manager who is not actively working one-on-one with a customer or working on a time sensitive issue will report to the 2nd floor to the Assistant Administrator of Customer Service or his/her designee to see how they can assist in the customer service process.  The “All Hands-on Deck” will be rescinded once the wait times are under the one hour thirty minutes wait time.  


LOGGING IN AND OUT OF Q-MATIC- 

Q-matic is the program that is used to call customers and account for all DMV transactions that are in
Queue at any given time.  

You must log into Q-matic in order to be able to call customers.  Ask a Supervisor if you have questions
or need assistance logging in.

You MUST log-out of Q-matic when leaving your workstation (breaks, lunches and end of day).

There are times when the Q-matic system may go down or not operate properly.  If this occurs, the Supervisors and/or Administration will take control of the situation and queue manually.

CRANSTON

A Supervisor and/or Administration will instruct customers to specific counters to be waited on.  You will not be able to call customers by queue and will must let your Supervisor and/or Administration know you are ready for your next customer by holding up your window number which is located at each work-station.

The Supervisor will hand out deli tickets and each CSR will verbally call numbers in case of Q-matic failure.  This is very rare but will be handled by Supervisors if Q-matic failure occurs.























RED RE-ENTRY CARD












If a customer needs to leave the building for a short period of time, for example to get the gross weight 
of their vehicle, and it's after 3:15 pm, this ticket will get them back into the building. This "Red Re-Entry Ticket" serves as a "hall pass" and will assist Capitol Police and Enforcement to identify who they should let back into the building after 3:15 pm.  


Few things to note:

•	These are only to be used after 3:00 pm each day;  
•	This ticket is issued by the Football Supervisor(s) only;
•	Capitol Police will collect this ticket from the customer when they re-enter the building;
•	This is only used at the Cranston Branch; and
•	The Blue Return ticket cannot be used for that purpose.  If a Blue Return ticket is given for this purpose, the customer will NOT be allowed back into the building.




















YELLOW TICKET- ADJUDICATION


 


If a customer is unable to complete their transaction due to a registration suspension or block, you will issue a yellow ticket. This ticket will allow the customer to be seen by Adjudication without a reservation.  These tickets are only for customers who have waited and are unable to complete their transaction due to a registration suspension or block. (For example, C4 or C5 suspension)

Ticket must include customer and clerk’s name and be validated.


















CSR WORKSTATIONS

It is the responsibility of each CSR to keep their workstation clean and organized.  Please be considerate when another CSR may be utilizing that workstation in your absence. Your workstation is in the public view.  Inappropriate items are prohibited from your workstation. Lockers in the break room are provided at the Cranston location. In the branches there are designated areas for your belongings. See specific branch Supervisor for specifics.  

We are all here to provide excellent customer service and do all we can to help customers accomplish their transactions while giving them a great experience.  All customers should be greeted when they approach your workstation, “Hello, how are you today?  How may I help you?” 

Cranston Workstations: 

•	There should be NO paperwork or miscellaneous items placed on the glass, which is between you and the customer, at your workstations.  Only the “payment methods” document (credit card acceptable payments for DMV) is allowed on the glass area.

•	Cell phones cannot be used for phone calls or texting at your workstation.

•	Everyone must be set up at their workstation and calling a customer at 8:30.

•	Please maintain your workstation in a clean and orderly fashion.

•	NO eating or open food containers at your workstation. A beverage with a cover/lid at your workstation is acceptable but please be careful with your beverage around the State’s equipment.

•	Validators must be locked up in drawers at the end of each workday.

•	Personal issues and/or politics should never be discussed with customers.

•	Internet/Email usage must not interfere with customer service and conform to DOIT’s acceptable use policy.

•	All OOS Licenses, Refund Applications, and any other miscellaneous items must be filed in the proper area.










YOUR “DAILY WORK” PROCEDURES


	Each CSR must use 2 manila folders daily for their scanned and completed work (License and Registration)

	The manila folder will be marked with the date, first name, last initial and either Registration or License depending on the work contained.  (Ex.  8-5-17 Matt S Registration)

	All work should be kept in their manila folder in order by sequential Transaction number

	At the end of the day the folders should be neat and orderly and have a rubber band placed around them in order to secure the paperwork from being lost.

	The manila folders will be placed in the Nova boxes located at each DMV location. (License and Registration each have their own box)



SCANNING USING “KNOWLEDGELAKE”

PROCEDURAL STEPS

1.	Place all paperwork to be scanned on the slot for the scanner to feed.

2.	Click “scan.”

3.	Twain box will populate, 

a.	ADF – Black and White (Used for Scanning all documents except for Licenses and Passports)
b.	Color – Drivers License and credentials (ID’s, passports, etc.)
c.	Flat Bed – Black and White (used for documents that cannot be fed through the scanner).
d.	Passport

4.	Once you have chosen your selection, you will then click the “scan” button.

5.	Once the documents have all been scanned it will populate the first page on the home screen.
 
If documents get jammed you will have to open the top of the scanner and remove them.  Once all jams have been removed you will click “retry”.

6.	Please review all scanned documents - delete any unnecessary pages (i.e. blank, illegible…) and rotate pages if necessary to ensure all pages are facing the same direction. 

7.	Click the “index” tab.


8.	Once all information has been indexed you will click “Accept”.

9.	Before leaving a PC, check for batches that were not released.  This can be done by pressing CTRL+A or you will click the bottom tab marked, “errors”.  If there are any records that are outstanding in this area, you MUST click on them and index them properly.	


Issues with scanning that you need to be aware of:

•	Scanners are not being cleaned daily.

•	Only credentials should be scanned in color (Licenses, ID’s Passports, green cards etc.).  Scanning in color is only done when doc being scanned will not be legible if scanned in black and white.  

•	Not previewing images before releasing the batches.  All scans should be previewed before being released.  Users would see these problems before releasing to servers (this is just a very quick scroll through the images to make sure they are okay).

•	Incorrect or No-Index data is being entered.

Scanners must be cleaned regularly, if not, the scans will have black lines going through them. Black lines also prevent the empty pages from being deleted because the software doesn’t see them as black due to the lines.  It wastes a lot of server space.  Color images take up 1000% more space than black & white and should only be used when necessary.


NOTE:   CSR’s are responsible for wiping down/cleaning their scanner using the spray and cloth from the cleaning kit on a daily basis.

























ID vs REAL ID

What is REAL ID?
On December 3, 2018, the DMV began offering REAL ID-compliant licenses and identification cards, which may be used for boarding a domestic flight or entering certain federal buildings or facilities beginning on May 3rd, 2023. The DMV offers these in compliance with the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, which established security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards. 

Do I need a REAL ID?
1.	REAL ID is an optional program. 
2.	You don’t need a REAL ID credential if you have a valid passport. 
3.	A REAL ID credential can be used to board domestic air flights and to enter secure federal buildings after stricter federal identification requirements are initiated on May 3rd, 2023 

When and where do I get one?
•	If you choose to obtain a REAL ID, you must complete the transaction in a DMV office. 
•	AAA members may also obtain a REAL ID at any of the association’s Rhode Island branch offices. For a list of AAA locations, see here. 
•	There is no additional cost for a REAL ID, when you apply for it during your renewal period. A REAL ID will cost $27.50 outside your renewal period. 

In a nutshell, RI offers REAL ID and Non-REAL ID credentials.  REAL ID is simply a fancy name for a more secure credential (ID or license).  To obtain a REAL ID, additional documentation must be provided.  See below for exact requirements.

IMPORTANT  NOTICE WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

The SSN is a unique personal identifier that does not tend to change, unlike a person’s name or address. SSNs have been widely available and, until recently, states have printed them on driver’s licenses, health care organizations have used them on insurance identification cards and SSNs often appear on financial documents and court records.
On December 18, 2010 President Obama signed into law the Social Security Number Protection Act of 2010. The law has two key components. 
First, the law establishes that no Federal, State, or local agency may display the Social Security account number of any individuals or any derivative of such number, on any check issued for payment by said agency. 
Second, the law prohibits Federal, State, or local agencies from employing, or entering into a contract for the use or employment of, prisoners in any capacity that would allow such prisoners access to the Social Security account numbers of other individuals. 
We issue three types of Social Security cards. All cards show your name and Social Security number.
1.	Shows your name and Social Security number and lets you work without restriction.
We issue it to: 

o	U.S. citizens; and
o	People lawfully admitted to the United States on a permanent basis.

2.	Shows your name and number with notes, "VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION." We issue this type of card to people lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis who have DHS authorization to work.
 
3.	Shows your name and number with notes, "NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT."
We issue it to people from other countries: 

o	Who are lawfully admitted to the United States without work authorization from DHS, but with a valid non-work reason for needing a Social Security number; or
o	Who need a number because of a federal law requiring a Social Security number to get a benefit or service.

Congress enacted the Privacy Act of 1974. The Act is primarily directed at federal agencies, but Section 7 (5 U.S.C. §552a note) also applies to state and local governmental agencies. It provides that: “It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual’s refusal to disclose his social security account number.” Sec. 7(a)(1).

The Privacy Act of 1974 also provides that “Any Federal, State or local government agency which requests an individual to disclose his social security account number shall inform that individual whether that disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it.” Sec. 7(b). Further, the Social Security Act Amendments of 1990 bars the disclosure of SSNs by federal, state and local governments collected pursuant to any laws enacted on or after October 1, 1990.

Some government agencies, including tax authorities, welfare offices, and state Departments of Motor Vehicles, can require your SSN number as mandated by federal law (42 USC 405 (c)(2)(C)(v) and (i)). Others may request the SSN, leading you to believe you must provide it.

The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual

The division of motor vehicles shall collect from applicants and licensees their social security numbers and tax identification numbers only to the extent required by federal law. Such numbers shall not be included, either digitally or visually, on the operator's or chauffeur's license.

NOTE: A social security number CANNOT start with a “9” or “666.”  Why?


1.	A “9” is an ITIN number, which means “Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.”

-	These are given to people who come to the U.S. and who have not procured valid proper documentation to obtain a social security number.  So, they are given this card so that they pay taxes, however, they are not eligible for a driver’s license.

2.	A “666” is a number used by RI Human Resources; it was used (years ago) to allow for temporary social security designation.  These are no longer used to obtain a driver’s license, however, there are two to three left in the state.

3.	A “000” will never be a valid social security number.




The information the division of motor vehicles collects and maintains on individuals is especially sensitive. An employee who inappropriately releases personal information is subject to criminal sanctions and/or termination.

The DMV began issuing new style Licenses and State Identification Cards as of Tuesday, July 19, 2016.  All state identification cards, commercial driver’s licenses, and regular operator’s licenses will reflect this new design.   Existing active licenses and state identification cards will remain effective until their expiration date.

If the customer gets two (2) or more letters wrong for both eyes, the customer has failed the eye exam and cannot transact any further, until they either pass the eye exam (glasses may be required) or get an eye card from a licensed optician stating their vision meets the legal requirement to hold a license/permit.  

If the customer wears contact lenses or glasses while taking the test and cannot pass the eye exam without them, he/she will be given an “A” restriction meaning contacts/glasses are required to drive.

•	Update Customer is necessary (address change etc.)

•	Select your transaction from Transaction Menu, for ex “Credential>License>Duplicate

•	You will receive a popup message stating “The photo capture request was sent successfully.  Please capture customer’s photo before proceeding.”  This is your cue to switch to the “Capture” application to take the photo.

•	Make sure photo is compliant based on criteria listed above and that the “Capture” application accepts the photo.  “Capture” application will try to match this photo with old photos of customer (if we have on file) to make sure it is the same customer and that it passes Facial Recognition.  If it clearly is not the same customer, stop and get a Supervisor.  If picture is not verifying due to standards not being met (eyes not open, bangs in face etc.)  follow the prompts to retake photo so that it meets the requirements. There may be occasional circumstances when a customer is disabled or the photo will not verify based on their facial features.  If this is the case you will have to override the photo and type in  “customer disabled” or other reasonable explanation as to why the photo had to be overrode.

State to State

What is State to State (S2S)?
The State-to-State (S2S) Verification Service is a means for states to electronically check with all other participating states to determine if the applicant currently holds a driver license identification card in another state. 
What is the purpose of the State-to- State service?

Every state in the U.S. has a law that restricts a person from holding more than one driver’s
license. These laws have existed for many years and states have relied upon an applicant’s self-attestation when signing their license application. With no ability to verify information (beyond
what an individual voluntarily offers a licensing agency), there has not been a mechanism to
confirm a person’s identity and their driving history. To remedy this, states built the State-to-
State Verification Service (S2S): An electronic tool that allows states to determine whether an
applicant already holds a license or ID card in another state.

S2S:
• Enable a State to determine if a person holds a REAL DL or REAL Identification Card in another State 
• Enable a State to determine if a person holds a DL or identification card in another State 
• Provide information on all State issued DL/ID’s nationwide 
• Enable States to verify DL/ID cards presented as a form of identification 
• Enable a State to send a request to another State to terminate a DL/ID . Limit a person to one REAL ID Card (whether a REAL DL or an REAL Identification Card) 
• Limit a person to one DL (whether a REAL DL or Customary DL)   



What are the implications? – 
Positive - include improved customer service, fighting and reducing Identity fraud, increased efficiency, ability to enforce the “1 credential in 1 state at a time” law.  In the past, we relied on the customer’s word.

Negative-  If you select YES and the credential/record does not actually belong to your customer, you are pulling that pointer and effectively merging that record with your customer’s.  In sum, you are joining two customers who are not the same person and cancelling the other individuals OOS credential in error.
 For example, Matthew Smith is renewing his RI license and another Matthew Smith (same name and DOB, not the same person) is displayed on the S2S tab, with a CT license.  After reviewing the details, you are still unsure whether the record is the same customer (there is no social number listed on the record).  In this case- select NO.   When in doubt, select no. This will cause a deficiency which will require a Supervisor override.  These records will be added to a report which will be reviewed by analysts to confirm that the pointer was not the same as the customer being transacted for.


RIMS Procedures for State -to-State

1.	Verify required documents.

2.	Search Customer.

3.	Verify and update the customer’s address and personal information prior to processing the transaction. Add new customer if necessary.

4.	Per REAL ID regulations, if the name in RIMS does not match the Identity document provided, perform an update customer to change the name prior to processing the transaction.  

4.	Initiate the RIMS transaction that’s being applied from the Transaction Menu at the top of the RIMS screen. i.e., New, Renew, Manage, etc.

5.	A pop-up will display directing you to take the photo: Capture and return to RIMS; 

6.	Click OK.

7.	Next, the following popup will appear.

•	If the customer is applying for a REAL ID credential- Select YES
•	If the customer is applying for a Non-REAL ID credential – Select NO
 
8.	Select Photo Matched checkbox to indicate photo matches the customer.

9.	Confirm/Enter the Customer’s Place of Birth: 
•	Country and State 
•	Country and Province.

10.	Confirm/Enter Customer’s Physical Information:
•	Height 
•	Weight
•	Eye Color 
•	Hair Color

11.	Confirm/Select Disabled Veteran, Veteran, or Service License, if applicable.

13. Under General Information, Verify the response entered in Step 8 is correct.

14. Select Yes or No to the citizenship question. 

15. Complete all the steps pertaining to the citizenship or non-citizenship screens.

16. Select Yes or No for the Organ Donor question (customer must be over age 16).

17. Select Yes or No for the Voter Registration question (customer must be over 16 and a U.S.  
       citizen, register to vote field is disabled for all permit transactions) 
•	If Yes, select the Party Affiliation from the dropdown menu.

18.  Select Yes or No for the Parental/ Guardian/Responsible Party consent question (only   
 enabled if customer is under 18).
     
19.  If Yes was selected for a Real ID credential or if your applicant is transacting a non-citizen  
credential then the Real ID tab will be displayed. Follow the standard procedural steps for the transaction being performed.
    
       20. Next the DL out of state tab will populate. If the customer is transferring a credential from out of state, click on the (+) symbol on the left bottom corner of your screen and enter the information into the DL out of state tab as usual. This information should be based on the customer’s driver’s license or driving record in the absence of the hard copy license or any other credential being transferred over from out of state. (remember that an additional Identity document is required if no hard copy license is presented.)

21.	When you arrive at the CDLIS/S2S Tab, if no pointer exists for your customer, select next and                    continue with the transaction. 

 

If a pointer(s) are displayed, you must determine if the record/credential, belongs to your customer. You must verify all the information displayed before selecting Yes or No.  If you need more information to determine whether the pointer/credential belongs to your customer, select Details for a more in-depth look.
NOTE:  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ONLY SELECT YES IF YOU ARE 100 PERCENT CERTAIN THAT THE POINTER/CREDENTIAL BELONGS TO YOUR CUSTOMER. BY SELECTING YES, YOU ARE PULLING THE RECORD FROM OUT OF STATE.  IT WILL BECOME PART OF YOUR CUSTOMER’S RECORD PERMANENTLY, WHILE ALSO SURRENDING THE OLD CREDENTIAL(S) BACK TO THE STATE(S) WHERE THE POINTER(S) ORIGINATED. AFTER REVIEWING ALL DETAILS, IF YOU ARE STILL UNSURE WHETHER THE RECORD/CREDENTIAL BELONGS TO YOUR CUSTOMER, ASK A SUPERVISOR FOR ASSISTANCE. 

22.	Once you have completed your selections, continue with the transaction as usual. Follow the standard procedural steps for the transaction being performed.  







PDPS


The Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS) is a system that allows jurisdictions and other organizations to search the National Driver Register (NDR) data. The NDR is a repository of information on problem drivers provided by all 51 U.S. jurisdictions. Based on information received as a result of an NDR search, PDPS "points" the inquiring jurisdiction to the State of Record (SOR), where an individual's driver status and history information is stored. Based on the information received from the SOR, the issuing state decides if the applicant is eligible to receive a new or renewed driver license. 

PDPS is developed and maintained by the National Driver Register organization, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).   

PROCEDURAL STEPS:

1.	Enter customer’s license number in for the type of transaction they are processing.

2.	Update customer information (name address etc.) if necessary before beginning transaction.

3.	The system will run through PDPS trying to find any possible suspensions during license and permit transactions.

NOTE: If the customer was suspended under the Operator status (if CDL status is suspended but Operator status is not, customer is still eligible for an Operator’s license), you would give them the reference number. The reference number for this is ME/8836270 (Maine is where there was a suspension and 8836270 is the assigned reference number for the customer to contact the State of Maine. Sometimes the reference number will be their driver’s license number.)

NOTE: If there were more than one possible suspension record, make sure each record is checked. The following situations could arise:

•	If the information is similar and you are unsure if it is the customer, check with your supervisor and the customer may be required to get a letter from that State, stating the possible suspension coming up in the system is not them.

•	If the social security number is different, it is not the customer. Continue past that record.

WHO REQUIRES AN EXAM

An exam is needed for

1.) A customer under 18 whom did not take the CCRI In State Drivers Ed Program but has completed an approved 33-hour Drivers Education program (Labontes, Newport County Driving School, JR’s, Safety Educators dba AAA, Roger Williams)

2)  A customer (18 or over) applying for a first-time license and does not have a valid RI license OR has a RI license that has been expired for more than five (5) years.

3)  A customer who has an Out of State License that is expired for over 5 years.

4)  A customer who has an Out of Country License (Including Canada)

NOTE: If the customer (under 18 years of age) has taken their 33-hour training course outside of Rhode Island (Customer will either have yellow CCRI Cert or a certificate of completion from an approved Driving School) they must also take the Rhode Island computerized exam.  See memo on next page for more details.

Please see below a list of schools that will be sending students directly to DMV with their own school’s completion certificate for driver’s education.  These students will no longer go to CCRI to get a CCRI yellow certificate. These students and their certificates should be treated as if they had received a yellow certificate from CCRI: They must take the DMV Permit Exam in Cranston. 

CCRI will still be issuing their Green certificates and they should be handled the same way as they currently are being processed. There still may be some yellow CCRI certificates out there so please make sure to handle them the same way as you have been instructed: They must take the DMV Permit Exam in Cranston.

The following schools have approved curriculums.  Customer must show certificate of completion and is required to take the computerized exam at Cranston DMV.

J.R.’S Driving School, Inc

If customer is under 18, has passed the 33 hour RI credited course (CCRI) and has the GREEN CCRI CERTIFICATE listing a passing “permit score” grade, they do NOT need to take the computerized exam and may be issued a permit on the spot.  If the CCRI certificate says NA or does not have a passing “permit score” grade, customer will be given credit for their 33 hours, but must take the computerized exam.  If the certificate says “class score” instead of “permit score”, the student did not take the required final exam through CCRI and must take the computer test at the Cranston DMV.

If customer has “Yellow Certificate”, a certificate from one of the above listed Driving Schools, or a CCRI cert with a failing “permit score” grade (F or grade below 70) they MUST take the computerized exam.



                                         
FIRST PERMIT


	First Limited Permit, US Citizen (Minor, customer is under 18 years of age):  Expiration dates will be set to 18th birthday or one (1) year from the date of transaction, whichever is longer.  This means that the DMV will sometimes issue limited permits to those whose term will span before-to-after their 18th birthday.  The assumption is that law enforcement officials can always check the D.O.B. to determine the driver’s age and therefore, what rules the driver needs to abide by (the document labeled “limited permit” converts to non-limited permit after 18th birthday).

	First Permit, US Citizen, (Non-minor, customer is over 18 years of age):  Expiration date will be one (1) year from the date of the transaction (not necessarily falling on their birthday).  A Non-minor permitee does NOT have to abide by the same rules and regulations as a minor with a Limited Permit.(They do not need a supervising driver to accompany them as long as they are operating in the state of RI.)  RI DMV is not responsible for knowing another State’s laws/policies on what is required to operate a vehicle with a RI permit in a different state.  It is the Customer’s responsibility to inquire about such laws/policies in another state if they plan on driving in aforementioned state/states.

	First Limited Permit, Temporary Resident Permit (Minor):  CSR must manually enter the expiration date (usually ‘visa end date’), maximum being one (1) year or 18th birthday, whichever is longer.  The permit may span over 18th birthday.  Basically, the same process as that of a US Citizen, but requiring the CSR to enter the expiration date and allowing a term of less than one (1) year.

	First Permit, Temporary Resident (Non-minor):  CSR must manually enter the expiration date (usually ‘visa end date’), with maximum being one (1) year.

	Limited Permit Renewal, Resident (Minor):  Similarl to the “First Limited Permit, Resident (Minor).”  Expiration date will be set to the 18th birthday or one (1) year from the date of the transaction, whichever is longer.  This means that the DMV will sometimes issue limited permits whose term will span from before-to-after their 18th birthday.

	Permit Renewal (Non-minor)-  Expiration date- 1 year from date of transaction.

INCOME TAX BLOCK


An Income Tax Block will only block a customer from processing Renewals of Licenses or Permits, New Registrations, Registration Renewals, Transfer of Registrations and Re-Registrations (Add registration) of vehicles.  A customer can still Update/Manage/Duplicate a License or Permit as well as update or Duplicate a Registration.

Taxation can clear the block themselves or provide the customer with a notarized letter from Taxation which states the Customer (by name) is in good standing with the RI Division of Taxation.  This letter can be used by CSR’s to perform a REMOVE INCOME TAX BLOCK transaction.  


NOTE: If a motorist has an income tax block and their license is expired, they cannot renew the license until they clear the tax block.

NOTE: If the license is expired, a motorist can get a State ID without doing a voluntary surrender. 

NOTE: If the license is still active and the person wants a State ID (which practically speaking does not make sense), they must do a voluntary surrender.

NOTE: You can only surrender a license that is legally active (i.e., not expired).






















LICENSE RENEWAL



NOTE: A customer can renew their license ninety (90) days prior to expiration and up to five (5) years after expiration.  After five (5) years customer MUST take the computerized exam and road test again and is in essence “starting from scratch.”

Make sure customer has selected a Party affiliation on the LI-1 form, if they wish to register to vote.  If they do not wish to register, they must check the  “opt out” box.  Non-citizens are not eligible to register to vote.




















UPDATE CUSTOMER 


Whenever any person applying for or receiving an operator’s or chauffeur’s license shall move from the address named in his or her application or in the license issued to him or her, or when the name of a licensee is changed by marriage or otherwise, that person shall within ten (10) days thereafter notify the division of motor vehicles in writing of his or her old and new addresses or of his or her former and new names and of the number of any license then held by him or her. Violations of this section are subject to fines.

NOTE: An Update Customer transaction must be done prior to the Manage Driver License transaction - Updating the Customer will make the necessary changes to the RIMS record but will not produce a new Credential.  The Manage  transaction is what actually produces the new credential.


Update Customer  transactions are performed for the following purposes:

1.	Change of address

2.	Change name (must have appropriate documentation)

3.	Change gender (must have appropriate documentation)

4.	Change or update DOB (must have appropriate documentation)

5.	Update tax town for Vehicle

6.	Update or add Social Security Number


Two variations of Update Customer  transactions


1.   Update Customer Request-  Customer is “requesting” to update their record. For example, customer is changing their address or a woman got married and changed her name.

2.   Update User Error- This Update is performed due to “Clerk Error” causing an inaccurate record.  For example, the clerk misspelled the customer’s last name.  User error transactions will never generate a fee.

NOTE: Once the Update Customer transaction is complete, you may Manage the credential to produce a new copy with the updated information if the customer requests an updated credential.  If the name, DOB, or sex has been changed you will be forced to produce a new credential with the updated information, as this is required by law.  Customer is responsible for any applicable fees.





MANAGE LICENSE 

M
Once the update has been completed and the record has been updated in RIMS, you may Manage the credential in order to produce an updated copy if the customer requests.  This is the transaction that will actually charge the customer (27.50) and generate a new credential to be manufactured and sent out.  

This is the transaction that is performed for a customer requesting a REAL ID credential outside of their renewal window. 

The following transactions are functions of Manage Driver License and will produce a new credential.


1. Duplicate
2. Update Customer request
3. Update User Error
4. Remove Provisional Status
5. Add a motorcycle endorsement. 



Address Change / Name Change (Customer is requesting a new License)

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR NAME CHANGE:

SAMPLE OF CHANGE OF GENDER DESIGNATION
 


Gender X

 All, 

Effective immediately, a 3rd gender option, X , has been added to RIMS. Gender X is defined as a non-binary gender—meaning the customer does not identity as male or female. Below is a detailed description of the document/procedural requirements necessary to perform this transaction. 

Documentation 
If a customer is changing their gender to X —they will be required to fill out a Gender Designation and LI-1 form. Currently, there is no option for gender X on either form. The customer will simply write in "X" on both forms (next to the male and female options). No additional documentation is required. To reiterate, medical documentation nor an amended birth certificate is required for a customer to change the gender on their credential. 

Procedural 

1)	Perform an Update Customer transaction. 

•	On the “Change Customer Info” tab—select the “Gender Change” box. This will open up the field on the right and allow you to select the gender from the dropdown. 
2)	As with all transactions where the name or gender is changed— RIMS will require a new credential to be     produced in the new name/gender (per law). If the customer is within their renewal window, renew the credential. If the customer is outside of the window to renew—manage the credential. 

3)	Scan documentation - Gender designation form, LI-1 and the customer’s current credential. You will have two coversheets—one for the Update Customer transaction and one for the Manage Credential or Renewal transaction. Scan and index the coversheets (and corresponding documents) separately. Write “updated gender” on the Update Customer coversheet. 
4)	If the customer is in possession of their current credential —take it— as they will be receiving a new hard copy in the mail displaying their updated personal information. If the customer has lost their current credential (or it was stolen), they must sign the Affidavit of Loss on the back of the LI-1
5)	If the customer is in possession of their current credential —take it— as they will be receiving a new hard copy in the mail displaying their updated personal information. If the customer has lost their current credential (or it was stolen), they must sign the Affidavit of Loss on the back of the LI-1.

PUBLIC PLATES

Public Plates

"Motor vehicle for hire" means every motor vehicle other than jitneys, public buses, hearses, and motor vehicles used chiefly in connection with the conduct of funerals, to transport persons for compensation in any form, or motor vehicles rented for transporting persons either with or without furnishing an operator. 

Private ambulance vehicles (Med Tech, Life Star, etc.) should be registered with Public plates, as the driver is being compensated for transporting persons.

Inter-Office Memo (dated April 1, 1999)

After legal review, the Division of Motor Vehicles has determined that all vehicles transporting passengers for compensation must have “Public plates.”

We consider compensation to be when the driver is paid during the time period s/he is transporting passengers.  For example, an employee of a motel chain may have many responsibilities including transporting passengers to and from the airport.  The vehicle used for such transportation must have public plates because the employee is being paid for the time s/he is transporting passengers.

Vehicles exempt from the public plate requirement include taxicabs, jitneys, public buses and motor vehicles used chiefly in connection with funerals.

Vehicles used by drivers being compensated to transport passengers are considered “for-hire” vehicles.  These vehicles include but are not limited to airport shuttles, limousines, and vans transporting clients of temporary job services.

To obtain a public plate, you must do the following:

1.	Make arrangements with your insurance company to have them file a GU-1338A form with the Financial Responsibility Office of the Division of Motor Vehicles.  Box #3 must be marked on the insurance certificate.  This form must be received by the DMV prior to registering the vehicles.  Financial Responsibility contact info: Phone: (401) 462-9246  |  Fax: (401) 462-5805

2.	Have a pre-registration inspection conducted on the vehicle at the Safety & Emissions Office (401-462-5890), located at 325 Melrose Street, in Providence.  If the vehicle passes inspection, the customer will have a pre-inspection form which needs to be given to the CSR at the time of registration.

3.	Bring the pre-inspection form to the DMV and prepare a registration application as a “new” registration.  Make sure the customer specifies to the Customer Service Representative that they are applying for

The use of the number plates shall be confined to the period of one year.
 
(b) The director of the department of revenue shall promulgate rules and regulations for the inspection of farm vehicles.

INTER-OFFICE MEMO: REGISTRATION WEIGHT


All Passenger Vehicle Types-   Take the shipping weight calculated by POLK, select the # of passengers, and hit Calculate GVWR.  This is the GVWR the vehicle should be registered with.  If different than what is listed on the TR-1 form, change the weight and write RIMS.  If the customer insists this weight is incorrect and is adamant the weight they provided on the TR-1 is correct, write PC (Per Customer).  Notify the customer that the car may not be able to be inspected if the weight is dramatically different, which would require them to return to DMV to have it corrected and pay any associated Registration fees based on the weight difference.

Trucks, Cargo Vans, Trailers-  The customer MUST provide the GVWR for these vehicles types because RIMS will either not populate a Shipping Weight, or the formula of adding the 150 lbs. per passenger to the Shipping Weight does not apply to these vehicle types.

MSO /CO-  Certificates of Origin can be used for Trucks, Cargo Vans, and other “Non-Passenger Vehicles” because the Calculate GVWR  formula does not apply.

DO NOT use the MSO/CO to enter GVWR for  Passenger vehicles.  Instead select the Calculate GVWR button to ensure the vehicle is registered with the same Gross Weight each time.  For example, when the first registered owner sells the vehicle and the new buyer comes in to register, an MSO will not be presented to enter the GVWR.  If we use the Calculate GVWR button from the first time it was registered, it will ensure the GVWR is entered consistently each time.

	If a preferred plate is expired more than 1 year, the customer must contact the “Constituent Affairs” Office within the Governor’s Office (401-222-2080), in order to receive a Governor’s Approved Card (pink).  The customer needs the pink card before continuing to have the plates reregistered. 

	If the customer is looking to request a preferred plate, their options are to fax, write or go in-person to the Governor’s Office.  If the plate is available, the Governor’s Office will have the plate produced and once it is available for pick up, a card will be mailed to the customer, informing them the plate is ready for pick up.

INQUIRIES
 


Chargeable inquiry 


This inquiry is used for the following:

Someone is processing a registration or tax only transaction and the vehicle is 2000 or older and they do not have proof of ownership OR

Someone needs to register their vehicle in another State that requires titles for vehicles 2000 or older. They will also require a certified copy of our Title Law letter.



Non-chargeable inquiry (DMV purposes)


Non-chargeable inquiries are used at the Supervisor’s discretion.  They may be used in instances where proof of prior ownership is required (non-titled vehicles) and the car is being gifted to an immediate family member (ex a 2000 Ford is being gifted from father to son, but the father lost his registration).  In a case like this a Supervisor may decide it is not necessary to charge the son 11.50 for an inquiry and may authorize a fee override.


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

•	Application for Registration and/or Driver License Information (RDL-1) form.

•	Identification.

•	Bill of Sale or letter or gift (if vehicle has been sold or gifted to customer).


NOTE: If the customer is requesting a certified copy of either the Registration and/or the Title Law Letter, they must request this from the Research department located at the Cranston DMV or at any DMV branch. (Reference title law letter for procedural steps) Make sure the screenshot of the registration screen is stamped with the validator that is marked “certified copy.

TITLE LAW LETTER


A Title Law Letter may be required for a non-resident to register a vehicle 2000 or older, sold by a RI resident, in a state which requires titles for vehicles 2000 or older, i.e., Mass. Since RI does not title vehicles that are older than 2001, this validated copy of our Title Law Letter will take the place of the title and allow the customer to register the vehicle out of state (when accompanied by a bill of sale and RI registration.)

TITLE EXAM – WHO, WHAT AND HOW?


	The title exam is a detailed review of the documents being submitted by a customer for a new registration or a registration transfer, where a title will be issued.

	All the necessary documents must be submitted by the customer.  The paperwork is checked for accuracy and completeness.

	The information being submitted is checked against the information that already exists in the DMV’s current system.

	A title is a legal document that proves ownership of a vehicle, because it is a legal document we must follow the rules and regulations put forth and mandated by RI General Law § 31-3-1.

	The title exam is the responsibility of the CSR; all required documents must accompany the transaction to execute the title certificate.

	When there is a discrepancy in the documentation for a titled vehicle, a “D6” suspension will be placed on that record, which will require additional work from the Research and Title Office and customer to rectify.

	It is extremely important to understand all types of title transactions and the requirements. When in doubt… check it out.

	A basic title exam involves the following steps:

1.	Determine the requirements for the transaction

2.	Verify that the necessary documents have been submitted (TR-1, TR-5 VIN CHECK if applicable), MVT-10, power of attorney, original title, etc.)

3.	Verify that the information is consistent between the forms:

a.	Make sure all signatures and printed names are present.
b.	Make sure mileage listings are present.
c.	Make sure the name, address, license number, and birth date provided by the customer matches the information in the system.
d.	Make sure that the VIN number is consistent between forms and in the system.

	A homemade trailer will never have a title.


     Title Conjunctions:  If two names are listed on the Title
  

If title lists “AND”,

If title lists “AND/OR”, 
a.	Without lien, one signature is required, if owner is not present, TR-1 notarized.

ONE-WAY PLATE CHANGE   



A one-way plate change is:

Customer wants a new plate due to their plates being lost/stolen.
OR
Customer is picking up their new plate (Vanity plate, preferred plate or was given a plate from someone.)
OR
Customer no longer wants their vanity plate and is requesting a standard wave plate.


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

	Identification

•	TR-1, notarized, if registered owner is not present.

•	Vanity Card application, if applicable. NOTE: If customer does not have the vanity card, you can still process the transaction (check to make sure the plate is present before performing the transaction.)

•	Plate letter(s), if applicable. 

•	Preferred Plate card from Governor’s Office, if applicable.

-	NOTE: If a preferred plate is being gifted to someone, you must also have a plate affidavit.  If preferred plate is being gifted to someone outside of the immediate family (grandparent or grandchild is considered immediate family for license plate purposes but not considered immediate for gifts of motor vehicles) then a Governor’s card is required as well as a gift letter from the owner of the license plate. 

•	Plates to be surrendered, if applicable.  

•	Police Report or Affidavit for Cancellation of Registration for lost plates, if one or both plate(s) were lost/stolen.














Plate Change Scenarios


1.  If the plate the customer is registering is currently registered to the same owner and has a longer expiration date than the plate that is being turned in, you must process the transaction as a transfer or add-registration, not as a plate change.

-	Example: My plate J-444, is valid until 2019 and the plate J-4, which is currently on the vehicle, is valid until 2018.  Transfer the J-444 plate as the plate has more time remaining than the plate on the car being turned in.


2.  If the plate the customer is trying to register is currently registered to the same owner and has a shorter expiration date than the plate that is being turned in, you must process the transaction as a cancel and reassign then a do a plate change.

-	Example: My plate J-444, which I am turning in, is valid until 2019 and the plate J-4, which I want, is valid until 2018 (you would need to cancel plate J-4 first).  In this case you would not transfer the J-4 plate because the registration has less time remaining then the plate that is currently on the vehicle.  When this is the case, process as a plate change after cancelling the current plate on the vehicle.


NOTE:   In order to perform a PLATE CHANGE both registrations must be of equivalent plate types. (Example passenger plate to passenger plate, or combination plate to combination plate.  You CANNOT plate change from a Commercial plate to a Combination plate or COMBINATION PLATE to a VETERAN PLATE etc. 


NOTE: When taking the cancelled plates from the customer, you must remove them from any plastic or any frame they may be in before placing them in the bin to be shredded.



















TWO-WAY PLATE CHANGE


A two-way plate change is a transaction where 2 vehicles switch license plates. Vehicle ownership does not have to be the same person (e.g., customer and neighbor, customer and family member, etc.)  The plates are swapped but the ownership of the vehicles does NOT change.  For example, my neighbor wants my plate and I want his.  A two way plate change could be done (I would write a gift letter to give my plate to him and he would write a gift letter to give his plate to me).  Ownership of the cars remains the same, the plates have simply been switched.

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

•	2 TR-1’s, notarized, if registered owner(s) is not present.

•	Identification

•	Plate letter(s), if applicable.

The transaction does not have a fee as the customer will NOT be receiving a new Registration.  Customers can also change their own address through DMV’s website located in  the “Online Services” section.

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

•	Change of Address Form


This transaction requires only that an UPDATE CUSTOMER  is performed (See Procedural steps for UPDATE CUSTOMER.)  No registration will be printed but the customer will be legally compliant once the change has been made in the system.  If the customer requests to have a new Registration printed, an Update Registration- Customer Request  would need to be completed as illustrated in the previous transaction above.  This would require the customer to fill out a TR-1 and pay $6.50.

UPDATE CUSTOMER-NAME CHANGE

CUSTOMER IS REQUESTING A NEW TITLE

NO LIEN - If a customer has legally changed their name and is requesting a new title in his/her name the original title MUST be submitted and signed over on the back (unless there is a lien -see below for instructions if there is a lien).  The owner will sign the old name as the seller, and new name as the buyer.  You CAN NOT create a new title for a customer without the original title being signed over and turned in (see below if lien).  The fee is $52.50 and it will take 8-10 weeks for the customer to receive the new title in the mail.

 LIEN- If there is a lien on the vehicle the customer will be allowed to sign an MVT-10 form (reassignment form) in place of the title.  The customer will sign the old name as seller and new name as buyer. This form is taking the place of the title as the lienholder has the original title.  A non-negotiable title will be created and sent to the lienholder and when the lien has been satisfied both titles will be mailed to the owner (original title in old name and non-negotiable in new name).  The owner will need to provide both titles to the buyer if/when selling the vehicle.

This transaction can also be performed to add or remove a second owner from a RI titled/registered vehicle.  Original title must be submitted and signatures must be present where applicable. 


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:

•	TR-1 form

•	Original title if no lien- for a name change- must be signed over from old name to new name on back of title

•	To add/remove an owner- Assignment on back of title must be signed over as necessary (gift letter or bill of sale also required if adding a second owner).

•	If there is a lien and customer is changing their name-  Print title Inquiry from RIMS if customer does not provide a copy of the title (check the “no fee” box).  Have customer sign an MVT-10 (reassignment form) over from the old name to the new name. 

Note:  Customer must show proof of name change (if name has not already been changed in RIMS).  For example, new social security card and supporting document such as marriage certificate, divorce decree, family court paperwork doc, etc.





PLATE CANCELLATIONS


A TR-3 form is issued when a customer is requesting to cancel the registration of their vehicle.  Either the plates are brought in, mailed in, or an Affidavit for Cancellation of Registration for Lost Plates is completed.  This transaction is performed in the Plate Office as well as with all CSR’s.

Often times, a customer requests a TR-3 for tax purposes when disputing an excise tax bill.  If the cancellation was performed in RIMS, you can provide a copy of the TR-3 which can be found under the “Transactions Tab”.  The TR-3 can be printed from the “Reprint Docs” section for 30 days after the transaction date.  After 30 days, it can be printed from the scanned “Transaction Docs” or backlog imaging.  If there is not a TR-3 in backlog images, you can provide the customer with a print out of the registration record via the “Vehicle Details “ screen which will indicate the expiration date of the plates.  If the customer needs something more detailed, they must contact the Research and Titles Office for all other inquiries. 

This service can be done at any DMV or AAA if customer is a member.  There is no need to send a customer to the Research and Titles Office to obtain these documents unless the town/city hall where the customer resides is requiring something on DMV Letterhead to dispute a tax issue. 

If the customer is requesting their plates be canceled, you will follow the procedural steps;


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

	Plates to be surrendered, if applicable OR

	Police Report or Affidavit for Cancellation of Registration for lost plates, if plate(s) were lost/stolen. 


PROCEDURAL STEPS:

Note: ALWAYS search by license, CID number or customer’s name and DOB when cancelling a plate.  Select the Vehicle tab in the customer’s profile and select the vehicle he/she wishes to cancel.  Do NOT search by license plate or VIN number unless absolutely necessary as this often results in cancelling the incorrect registration.

Note: You must check to see if there is a pending C-4 or C-5 suspension before cancelling plate(s).  If there is a pending C-4 or C-5, DO NOT CANCEL- send customer to the Adjudication Office.


NOTE: Hand your customer the TR-3 receipt.  Ask customer to verify all information is correct before leaving.

NOTE: When taking the cancelled plates from a customer, please remove them from any plastic bags/plate holders before discarding into plate bins.

LEASED VEHICLE REGISTRATION RENEWALS


A registration renewal is performed when a registration has been expired for less than 3 calendar months.  If the “Reg Status” is listed as “Expired” the plate is eligible to renew.

 CHANGE OF LESSEE/ UPDATE OWNERSHIP TYPE


The only time this transaction would take place is when the Lessee is changing but the Leasing Company is remaining the owner.  For example, the vehicle is registered and titled to Honda Lease Trust but the Lessee is changing.   Technically this is not a “New Registration and Title” transaction because the Leasing Company is remaining the owner (title is not changing), we are simply updating the Lessee information.  Follow the steps listed below to perform a TITLE>MANAGE TITLE>UPDATE OWNERSHIP TYPE  transaction.  Note: The 2nd step (Update Ownership Type) must be completed by a Supervisor.  The first step is for the CSR to cancel the plates and then the Supervisor will “Update Ownership Type”. Finally, the CSR will perform an “Add Registration”.  Step by step instructions below.


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:

•	TR-1, notarized, if lessee is not present.

•	Lease agreement, if lessee is changing.

•	Power of Attorney, if lessee is changing.

•	Identification 




















TITLE AND TAX ONLY











Title and Tax Only transactions can be processed at any DMV location or at the Division of Taxation located at One Capitol Hill in Providence RI.

Title and Tax Only transactions are often done when a customer does not plan on registering the vehicle and wishes to simply sell it.  In order to legally sell a vehicle, a private party (non-dealer) must pay the sales and obtain a title in their name (if 2001 or newer) before legally selling the vehicle. 

Another scenario where a Title and Tax Only may be done is when a customer buys a vehicle that is not ready for the road (may not pass inspection because it needs work.)  In this case, to avoid paying sales tax penalty down at a future date, the customer may choose to do a Title and Tax Only transaction.  In this case, the sales tax will be paid without accruing interest and penalty and a title will be created in the customer’s name.  When the customer decides to register the vehicle, an Add Registration can be performed (think of it as adding a registration to a vehicle that is already titled to them.)

If the customer is sending the vehicle out of the country and the vehicle has never been registered in RI, the vehicle must be registered; however, they will not be required to insure the vehicle because the DMV will immediately cancel the registration, once completed. You will issue the customer a registration and a TR-3 ( plate cancellation form.)  The customer will then proceed to the Research and Title Office at the Cranston DMV or any branch location to obtain a certified copy of the “Title Law Letter’.

If the customer is sending the vehicle out of country and the vehicle has been registered in RI, you will process a  Title and Tax Only. Once the customer has completed their transaction they will proceed to  “Research and Title Office” at the Cranston DMV or any branch location to obtain a certified copy of the Title Law Letter.

Vanity plates are only available for the following types of plates:

1.	Passenger plates
2.	Commercial plates (Gross weight cannot exceed 9,000 lbs)
3.	Motorcycle plates (Maximum of 5 characters)
4.	Antique plates

Vanity plates can be ordered:

5.	Online with a major credit card
6.	By mail with a check or money order

NOTE: Any vanity plate deemed offensive or inappropriate will NOT be processed by the DMV.


DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

•	Vanity License Plate application


-	NOTE: If the customer is requesting a Specialty Design plate (i.e., NE Patriots, Red Sox…), they must order the plate first as a “Wave” plate.  Once the plate has been registered, the customer may order the vanity plate in any design they choose by filling out DMV Charity Plate form and submitting payment to a CSR.


VANITY PLATE PICK UP-  Once the vanity plate arrives at the location selected by the customer on the order form, the customer must appear at the given location (or have the TR-1 notarized if he/she is not present) and register the plate.  This will either be done as Plate Change if the vehicle has existing plates, a New Registration and Title if customer is registering a new vehicle (new to them) with the vanity plate, or an Add Registration, if registering a vehicle that currently belongs to the customer but is in “Cancelled” status.  Below are the procedural steps for a Plate Change Transaction

DOCUMENTS REQUIRED: 

•	Completed TR-1, notarized, if the registered owner is not present.

•	Valid RI insurance information (if temporary, insurance card must be shown)

•	Identification.

•	Plates to be surrendered, if applicable.

•	Registration.


NOTE: When the customer has greater than twelve (12) months left on their registration, the system will charge an additional fee other than just the standard plate change fee.  The reason being is that a vanity plate registration fee is double that of a standard plate’s reg fee.  The customer is being charged for the additional one (1) year remaining on the registration.

ISSUING 5-DAY TEMPORARY PLATES



•	Who gets a five-day temporary plate?  Only vehicles that are 2001 and newer, that have an out-of-state title requiring a VIN inspection, qualify for such a plate.  

•	The DMV issues a five-day temporary plate (cardboard) for the purpose of moving an unregistered motor vehicle to a Vin Inspection Station to obtain a VIN verification.  The temporary plate should be placed on the back bumper or in the same location that the back license plate would normally be affixed.

•	The VIN check is needed for vehicles 2001 or newer.  Effective January, 2011, we will title vehicles from 2001 and newer.  

•	Five-day temporary plates expire five (5) business days after issuance and will be stamped accordingly.  The beginning of the five-day period begins the following day, after the temporary plate has been issued. For example, if temporary plate is issued on Monday June 1st, it will expire on June 8th which is the following Monday.

•	The five-day plate shall be of such design and shall bear the letter “T” followed by five (5) or six (6) digits.  Regulation provides that there shall be no duplication of these plates.

•	A Temporary Registration will be issued corresponding to the plate number.  Inform the customer to keep the Registration in the glove compartment in case he/she gets stopped by the police and needs to provide proof of valid Registration.

•	Original out-of-state title and an appropriate Bill of Sale, if applicable, must be presented to the DMV prior to the issuance of a five-day temporary plate.

•	Applicants for five-day plates are to be informed that the plates are issued for the primary purpose of a VIN inspection and only one five-day plate is allowed.  Once they have received the VIN Inspection form (TR-5) they can now permanently register their vehicle.

•	Five-day plates are not to be issued to any motor vehicle dealer.  Individuals may apply for and use five-day plates for the purpose of having salvage vehicles inspected once their salvage inspection appointment has been scheduled.

•	A fee of $10.00 + $2.50 technology support fee ($12.50 total) will be charged for each issuance of five-day plates.

•	If the title is in the possession of the lienholder, we require a photocopy of the front and back of the title.

Gifting Vehicles

•	Gift Letters Immediate Family- Gifting a vehicle to an immediate family member ( spouse, mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter or stepmother, stepfather, stepson , stepdaughter, stepsister, stepbrother) requires only a gift letter and title to be signed over from old owner to new owner (if vehicle is 2001 or newer-if older than 2001 proof of prior ownership is required).  The gift letter does not need to be notarized and there is no sales tax charged for the transaction.

•	Gift Letters Non Immediate Family –  Gift letters MUST be notarized and accompanied by the Green Tax Exempt card (T-333), if gifted from someone other than immediate family (spouse, mother, father, stepfather, stepmother, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, child or stepchild).  Additionally, a person receiving the gift of a vehicle from anyone other than an immediate family member, must complete a “Affidavit of Gift of a Motor Vehicle” form.  The gift letter, gift affidavit and sales tax exemption certificate should be combined after scanning documents and kept with your sales tax forms.

•	If there is a lien on the vehicle, the vehicle cannot be gifted, unless the lienholder releases the lien and provides written permission for the new owner to register/title the vehicle in their name and assume responsibility of the lien. Title will then be signed over from person giving the gift as the “Seller” to the person receiving the gift as the “Buyer.”  The vehicle will be registered and titled to the new owner and the lien will be recorded.  The new title will be mailed to the lienholder in 8-10 weeks.

•	Out-of-State Questionnaire – Used to verify the tax paid to another state, when moving into Rhode Island and transferring the registration.  The taxpayer must provide the title (if 2001 or newer or registration of the vehicle (if older than 2001).  Check BOX # 2 and record the title and registration numbers and the state the taxpayer is moving in from, in BOX # 4 of the T-333 form.  This must be filled out completely.

If “yes” has been answered for any of the questions, the taxpayer must be questioned.  The determination needs to be made as of whether customer was a RI resident and thus owes Sales tax to the State of RI.  

The two major determining factors are- did customer buy the vehicle and then move to RI within 90 days or purchase, and did the customer own property in RI at the time of the purchase.  If customer answered “Yes” to either one of these questions, they would need to provide proof of the sales tax paid in the other state (Bill of Sale, Registration showing sales tax paid, or sales tax receipt), so we could give credit for those taxes and charge the difference in RI.   For example, if the customer lived in Mass, bought and registered a car on June 1st 2017, then moved to RI on 8-15-2017, he or she would be responsible for paying the difference in sales tax to the State of RI.  Customer would provide Bill of Sale showing 6.25 % Sales tax paid in Mass and we would give credit for this amount and collect the .75 % difference when registering the vehicle in RI.

SAMPLE OF OUT-OF-STATE QUESTIONNAIRE


•	If a car is purchased within ninety (90) days by an out-of-state resident and given as a gift to a Rhode Island resident, tax is due on the difference in tax rates (ex: 6.25% Mass tax paid, .75% RI tax is due.)










































•	Military Personnel – if a taxpayer is a Rhode Island resident in the military and purchases and registers a vehicle in the state where they are stationed, the customer will owe the difference between the tax paid and the 7% Rhode Island tax.  This is done when the customer comes to the DMV at a subsequent time after the original purchase.
•	Dual Residents (example: RI and FL) – Rhode Island resident with a residency in Florida purchases a vehicle and registers it in Florida.  If they subsequently register the vehicle in Rhode Island, the difference between Florida’s sales tax and Rhode Island’s sales tax must be paid, if applicable.

•	If the taxpayer moves to Rhode Island within ninety (90) days of purchasing the vehicle, the difference between the Rhode Island 7% sales tax and the amount paid to another state (if less than 7%) will be due.

•	Trailer Sales – Attach a copy of the Bill of Sale to the T-333 form, verifying that the Rhode Island sales tax has been paid.  In BOX # 4 of the T-333 form, write “Tax paid to retailer.”  If the trailer is purchased in another state, the taxpayer will owe the difference between the tax paid in that state and the Rhode Island 7% tax (if less then 7%).
  
Homemade trailers are tax-exempt (T/E). Write “Homemade trailer” in BOX # 4 of the T-333 form.

            IF THE HOMEMADE TRAILER IS PURCHASED, 7% SALES TAX IS OWED FROM THE
	SALE.

            If a boat and trailer are purchased as a package price, allocate 10% of the price to the trailer for
            tax purposes.

•	Credit for tax paid in another state on the purchase of a vehicle must be verified as follows:

•	Taxpayer must have taken possession of the vehicle from the dealer in a non-reciprocal state (ex: MA, FL)
•	Taxpayer must pay tax to the non-reciprocal state at that state’s tax rate
•	Tax form, stamped by other state, must list sales price and tax paid and is should be attached to the top sheet of the T-334 form
•	Credit is allowed for proper tax paid in another state, against the 7% Rhode Island tax due on the taxable sales price
•	If the vehicle is delivered to Rhode Island, the 7% Rhode Island state tax is due

TITLE EXAM – WHO, WHAT AND HOW?


	The title exam is a detailed review of the documents being submitted by a customer for a new registration or a registration transfer, where a title will be issued.

	All the necessary documents must be submitted by the customer.  The paperwork is checked for accuracy and completeness.

	The information being submitted is checked against the information that already exists in the DMV’s current system.

	A title is a legal document that proves ownership of a vehicle, because it is a legal document we must follow the rules and regulations put forth and mandated by RI General Law § 31-3-1.

	The title exam is the responsibility of the CSR; all required documents must accompany the transaction to execute the title certificate.

	When there is a discrepancy in the documentation for a titled vehicle, a “D6” suspension will be placed on that record, which will require additional work from the Research Office and customer to rectify.

	It is extremely important to understand all types of title transactions and the requirements. When in doubt… check it out.

	A basic title exam involves the following steps:

12.	Determine the requirements for the transaction

13.	Verify that the necessary documents have been submitted (TR-1, TR-5, MVT-10, power of attorney, original title, etc.)

14.	Verify that the information is consistent between the forms:

a.	Make sure all signatures and printed names are present.
b.	Make sure mileage listings are present.
c.	Make sure the name, address, license number, and birth date provided by the customer matches the information in the system.
d.	Make sure that the VIN number is consistent between forms and in the system.

QUICK TIPS FOR TITLE PROCESSING

TITLES:

MA:  “Owner retained” cannot be registered in the State of Rhode Island.

NY:  If the lien has been released, a separate lien release must accompany the title.  Lienholders in New York do not keep the title, so the customer should have it.  

All Out-of-State Titles 2001 and newer:  Must have a TR-5 (VIN CHECK)

Mileage:  Must be on the title and supporting documents.
	
TITLE ASSIGNMENTS:  Must have name and address of buyer, name and address of lienholder 
(including zip code), buyer’s printed name and signature, seller’s printed name and signature, and mileage.

AFFIDAVIT OF CORRECTION:  Letter must come from the seller, be signed by seller and list VIN or Title Number.  If from a dealer, must be notarized and on dealer letterhead.

TR-1:  Any cross-outs on the lienholder section of the TR-1 will void the entire document.

TR-5:  Slight mileage discrepancies are allowable on the TR-5.  No cross-outs are permitted.  The TR-5 must have a negative NCIC stamp or notation.

POA:  An original POA must be seen if a POA is required (New Registration and Title for Leased Vehicle etc.)  A copy of the entire POA must be taken. The original POA should not be taken unless the POA is specific to the transaction being processed.  The VIN and car description does not have to be on the POA unless the POA is specific to the transaction being processed.

RI SECURE POA:  The dealer must complete the assignment on the back of the title.  The Secure POA must be completely filled out.

AUTHORIZATION OF PAYOFF:  The DRT-1 (MA) or authorizations for other states take the place of the applicable assignment.  

DEATH CERTIFICATE:  Original death certificate must be presented.  Copy should be marked, “original seen.”  This certificate is needed for Sole Heir or Surviving Spouse transaction.

SOLE HEIR AFFIDAVIT:  The “Sole Heir Affidavit” takes the place of the applicable assignment.  There can be no probate pending if a “Sole Heir Affidavit’ is being presented.  Order of inheritance is children – parents – siblings.  Title must still be submitted if applicable (2001 and newer), however, it does not need to be signed as the heir affidavit is being used as the assignment.

MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE:  A copy of the marriage certificate is acceptable.  In the case of a divorce, the divorce decree must be shown.

PROBATE PAPERS: Original Probate Papers must be seen, a copy must be made.  A will is not acceptable.  Probate supersedes all other claims.

MSO/CO: Vehicle is new and is direct from the manufacturer - it needs a MSO or CO.  Campers/camper trailers: A copy of the CO must be taken for proof of weight.

MOTOR SCOOTERS AND MOPEDS
15

DMV Memorandum:


This memorandum is to clarify the difference between MOTOR SCOOTERS (motor driven cycles) and MOPEDS (motorized bicycles).

The general rule of thumb is:

If it does not have pedals capable of propelling the vehicle by human power, it is NOT a moped- it is a Scooter ( if more than 50 cc it is a Motorcycle). (Registration Code 04-04).


Additionally:

To be registered as a Moped, it must also have a motor rated no more than one and one half (1-1.5) brake horsepower or two (2) S.A.E. horsepower which is capable of a maximum speed of not more than thirty miles per hour (30 mph).

Electric motorized cycles with a motor rated no more than two (2) S.A.E. horsepower and which is capable of a maximum speed of no more than twenty-five miles per hour (25 mph) are not required to be registered (RIGL 31-3-2.2).

Important-   Rhode Island titles all Scooters that are 2001 and newer. Mopeds are non-titled. 99.9 % percent of all “Mopeds” are actually “Scooters” by RI law and must be treated accordingly (Title and Vin check required if 2001 and newer with Out of state title.)

o	A change of ownership adding/deleting a name can ONLY be done with an original title.
o	Answer, “No” when asked, “Is original title submitted?”  By answering “no,” this will generate a non-negotiable title (not valid for sale of a vehicle.)  When the loan has been paid, the lienholder (bank) will release the lien and mail both titles to the owner (the original title in the old name and non-negotiable title in the new name- If the owner sells the vehicle, both titles must be submitted to the buyer.) 




















IN THE CASE OF A DEATH 



When a person passes away and a customer is either attempting to register the vehicle in their own name, or sell it to another party, you must first determine who has the legal authority to register or gift/sell the vehicle(s).

The first step is to determine:


•	Is there a Probate?  

          If not

•	Is the Surviving Spouse attempting to register or sell the vehicle?

             If there was no Executor/Administrator appointed by the Probate court to carry out the will AND there is no Surviving Spouse attempting to register or sell the vehicle, then the “Sole Heir” would inherit the rights to register or gift/sell the vehicle.

•	Who is the Sole Heir?

Once you have determined who has the legal authority to register or gift/sell the vehicle, follow the instructions on the next page for the appropriate scenario (Probate, Surviving Spouse, Sole Heir) to determine which documents are required to register the vehicle.


.


















PROBATE


The designation of an Executor by a Probate Court supersedes all other inheritance claims.

An Executor of a “Will” is not acceptable.  The DMV does not accept wills.  Once a customer states that there is a probate or probate pending, nothing can be done until the Probate court issues the legal document appointing the Executor/ Administrator of the Estate. 


For an Executor to complete a transaction, they must have the following:


	Probate papers must be presented designating an Executor.

	Death Certificate is not required when letter of appointment from Probate Court is submitted.  However, please attach, if available.

	The original probate document must be seen.  A copy of the probate doc must be made and kept with the accompanying DMV work.

	The designation of an Executor by a Probate Court supersedes all other inheritance claims.

	A “Will” is not acceptable.  The DMV does not accept wills.

	If Co-Executors are named, both must sign the back of the title.

	Probate-appointed executors complete the transfer of ownership on the title certificate.

	The verbiage Executor, Executrix, Administrator and Administratix may be used interchangeably. 

	The probate papers must designate the estate in question as well as name the Executor/Executrix.  The papers must be dated and signed by a Court representative.

	Once all docs have been verified follow the steps and procedures to perform a “New Registration and Title” transaction on page 255-256.  
























































SURVIVING SPOUSE


In order to process this transaction, you must first find out if the estate has been probated or if there is a probate pending. If yes, you must follow the probate procedure above.  If there is no probate or probate pending and the spouse wishes to register the vehicle in their name, you will perform a “New Registration and Title” and follow the procedure for Surviving spouse listed on pages 279-284
  
This transaction is only for Rhode Island registered vehicles. If the customer is transferring from Out of State and the vehicle was not registered to the deceased in RI, the surviving spouse will be required to pay the title and registration fee.


	Original Death Certificate or certified copy must be presented and marital status must be verified on the Death Certificate.

	A title certificate in the name of the decedent must be presented.  If the Surviving Spouse wishes to register the vehicle to themselves, the spouse must sign as both seller and buyer as he/she is essentially selling the vehicle to themselves as the surviving spouse.  

	If the Surviving Spouse is gifting or selling the vehicle to another party, the spouse must sign the title as the “seller” and provide the original Death Certificate to the buyer (this will be scanned and given back immediately.)  A Bill of Sale or Gift Letter must be provided by the Surviving Spouse. 


IF there is no Executor/Administrator follow the procedure on the next page for “Sole Heir”.



















SOLE HEIR AFFIDAVIT   
 

The Sole Heir Affidavit is needed when:


	There is no probate or probate pending.

	There is no surviving spouse.

	The order of inheritance is as follows:

o	Children
o	Parent/Parents
o	Siblings

	If an Heir Affidavit is presented:

o	If there are children, all children must sign.
o	The there are no children, parent or parents must sign.
o	If there are no children and no parents, all siblings must sign.

	The Heir Affidavit takes place of the assignment.  The title assignment is not completed on the title certificate.

	If there is no probate-appointed Executor and an individual is not eligible for an Heir Affidavit, they may apply for permissions as a “voluntary executor” under the Small Estates Statute.

Documents required:

•	Title if 2001 or newer, or proof of ownership (older than 2001) of the decedent.

•	Vin check if out of state title 2001 and newer

•	Original Death Certificate

TRUSTS: REVOCABLE OR IRREVOCABLE
























Revocable Trusts

A revocable trust or "Grantor trust" is a term used in the Internal Revenue Code to describe any trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. All "revocable trusts" are by definition grantor trusts.  If a trust is a grantor trust, then the grantor is treated as the owner of the assets and the trust is disregarded as a separate tax entity. 

The transfer of a motor vehicle into a revocable trust is not subject to the Use Tax provided that the grantor has paid the last tax due on the vehicle and that the transfer occurs within 90 days of the trust being formed. If the vehicle is transferred into the trust after 90 days, the transfer is deemed to be a casual sale and would be subject to the tax at book value.  If the trust purchases a motor vehicle from a licensed motor vehicle dealer, the trust is liable for the tax.

The transfer of a motor vehicle from a revocable trust to the grantor is not subject to the Use Tax as long as the grantor or the revocable trust has paid the tax.



Irrevocable Trusts

An irrevocable trust is a trust, which, by its terms, cannot be modified, amended or revoked.  State law and the trust instrument establish whether a trust is revocable or irrevocable. If the trust instrument is silent on revocability, then most states consider the trust revocable.		

The transfer of a motor vehicle into an irrevocable trust is not subject to the Use Tax provided that the grantor has paid the last tax due on the vehicle and that the transfer occurs within 90 days of the trust being formed. If the vehicle is transferred into the trust after 90 days, the transfer is deemed to be a casual sale and would be subject to the tax at book value.  If the trust purchases a motor vehicle from a licensed motor vehicle dealer, the trust is liable for the tax.

The transfer of a motor vehicle from an irrevocable trust is subject is deemed to be a casual sale and is subject to the Use Tax at book value.
